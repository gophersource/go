## New to GitHub?

If you decide to contribute (we hope you do :smile:), the process is familiar and easy if you've used Github before. There are no long documents to read or complex setup. If you haven't used Github before, the awesome [@bketelsen](https://github.com/bketelsen) has created a good overview on how to contribute code - see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSDcTyysRc).
