This document lays out generally how we want to work with each other. It's hard
to make a rule or set a guideline for each and every situation that might come
up in our community. That's basically predicting the future!

We do of course set some boundaries like the [code of
conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html, but
we want to fall back to this document for guidance when we encounter a new
situation or question that we need to address.

# Guiding Principles

This is the TL;DR of the whole document! The GopherSource project has a few
guiding principles:

- Be kind to each other
- Make development & testing easy
- Focus on our Community
- Ask Questions

In the rest of this document, we're going to go into detail for each of these items.

# Be Kind to Each Other

We firmly believe that a kind, welcoming and constructive community comes first,
and code and technology second. If the folks in the community around this
project aren't kind to each other, it doesn't matter how cool our technology is.

- Make newcomers feel welcome.
- Keep debates in Github issues, and be civil and constructive in them.
- [Listen more than you talk](https://hbr.org/2017/02/in-a-difficult-conversation-listen-more-than-you-talk).
- Respect that everyone is in different time-zones, don't exclude people outside
  of the majority time-zone.

Most importantly, **be inclusive**. Not everyone will share your point of view,
communication style, and many other things. Consider their point of view
and treat them with respect.

# Make Development & Testing Easy

Cognitive load is bad when you're writing code, so let's try to minimize it.

- Getting started should be a one-liner.
- Let's make the hard things easier.
- Docs are good, let's keep them up-to-date.
- Let's make it pleasant to work with our code.

# Focus on our Community

There's an African proverb that goes like this:

>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

We want to apply that wisdom to our community.

- It's easy and sometimes tempting to do everything yourself.
- But if we want to keep the project growing, it's hard to have just a few people doing everything.
- Related: [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).
- So let's focus on bringing new people into the community, and getting them started (see: Be Kind to Each Other, above).

# Ask Questions

Questions are a great way for us to share ideas and make the project and community better.

- If you don't know something, try not to be afraid to ask.
- If you think your question is stupid, ask it anyway.
- ... And if you're still uncomfortable asking in public, ask a maintainer in private.
- If someone asks you a question, it's ok to answer it later.
- Put answers on paper where everyone can read them, if you can.
- ... And FAQs are great to have - let's do them!
- Newcomers have the best perspectives, so listen well to their questions.
